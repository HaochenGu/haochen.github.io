Achieving a high grade often requires knowledge at an undergraduate level. I earned an &amp;lsquo;A,&amp;rsquo; the highest grade awarded by the IB system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I won’t delve deeply into the content—since its complexity no longer feels challenging given my current level—I focused on modeling the distribution of various random variables and explored how to determine the distribution of their sum. This journey led me to concepts like characteristic functions and Fourier transforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose this essay for my first blog post because it played a key role in teaching me how to learn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Initially, I believed that to achieve something, all I needed was to study the things directly related to my goal. For example, I thought that to write an essay on Fourier transforms, I didn’t need to understand Fourier series derivations. After reading material solely about Fourier transforms, I realized I still couldn’t clearly explain the concept. So, I revisited Fourier series and learned how to derive it on my own. Suddenly, why Fourier transforms extract &amp;ldquo;charcteristics&amp;rdquo; of functions became clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This realization significantly shaped my academic trajectory, ultimately leading me to pursue mathematics at the undergraduate level. While my long-term goals include becoming something like a &amp;ldquo;Machine Learning Researcher&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Quantitative Analyst,&amp;rdquo; I believe the most valuable approach isn&amp;rsquo;t to spend three years studying specific tools. Instead, a deep dive into the fundamentals of mathematics feels essential. By becoming a statistician and then contributing to the field of machine learning, I’m more likely to make meaningful progress.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is an extremely useful rule when doing code. Before writing my EE, I knew little about python and nothing about LaTeX. I felt all the books and videos I could find are extremely boring. So instead of slogging through them, I jumped right into the practical work—I started with data scraping and visualization using Python, and began drafting my essay in LaTeX. Every time I encountered a problem, I searched for a solution on the spot and continued from there. The program for my essay was completed in half a day, and I even began earning money by writing LaTeX for others after finishing the first draft of my essay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>http://localhost:1313/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/about/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="education">Education&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>I was born in Yancheng and didn’t receive an education outside of Yancheng until high school. I often emphasize this because my background has had a big impact on me, even if most people probably don’t know the city. Yancheng pushed me to work harder and think more because I didn’t want to stay there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before high school, the praise from adults felt empty. Sure, I was clever and could be number one in all the science subjects in my class, but so what? They said this could get me into a good university, but how? They said a good university would lead to a good job, but what kind of job? The education system in a city like Yancheng couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer these questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I know I can do a math degree, and I’m interested in technology, so I’m planning to pursue a PhD in machine learning. I found that, the higher environment I am in, the better sense of direction I have, which I think necessary to our life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
