### Some muttering

I was born in Yancheng and didn’t receive an education outside of Yancheng until high school. I often emphasize this because my background has had a big impact on me, even if most people probably don’t know the city. Yancheng pushed me to work harder and think more because I didn’t want to stay there.

Before high school, the praise from adults felt empty. Sure, I was clever and could be number one in all the science subjects in my class, but so what? They said this could get me into a good university, but how? They said a good university would lead to a good job, but what kind of job? The education system in a city like Yancheng couldn't answer these questions.

Now, I know I can do a math degree, and I’m interested in technology, so I’m planning to pursue a PhD in machine learning. I found that, the higher environment I am in, the better sense of direction I have, which I think necessary to our life.
