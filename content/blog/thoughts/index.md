As a young person, I find it incredibly easy to change my mind and develop new ideas rapidly. Sometimes, this process feels almost too fast—especially when I reflect on the past four years.

## Academic Thoughts

I define this blog as an academic blog, so it's better to start from academics. 

At 16, my goals were simple: get into a "good" university. At that time, I had no clear idea of what "good" even meant. Gradually, I defined "good" as a university that could provide me with strong career prospects and a chance to live in a developed country. However, when the time came to choose between offers, I made a decision I still appreciate: I chose Imperial College London. Deep down, I felt, *"I’m still young. I want to learn more."*

After starting university, I was caught up in another mindset: *"My family isn’t wealthy enough to support a high-quality lifestyle for me after graduation. When my parents retire, I must earn at least as much as my father."* But after working in an investment banking for two months, I realized: *I would never survive doing such a boring job for the rest of my life.* This experience clarified my ambitions. I want to pursue work that keeps me engaged, even when I get 60 years old, I am still staying on the cutting edge of technology and solve meaningful problems.

To achieve this, I’ve decided that pursuing a PhD is essential. I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on this choice, knowing it may be difficult to convince my parents, who are financial sponsors, who don’t fully understand my reasoning. But I believe they will eventually see that there’s nothing more important than finding meaning in life.

## Emotional Management

My emotional management during high school was a disaster. I was too easy to take anything to seriously and overestimate their impact. More seriously, I didn't realize it and thought it's normal. Fortunately, I tried my best to control my emotion and I didn't get much chances to deeply sharing it with others, such that I didn't hurt others due to it... except one person.

During application season, I met someone very similar to me. We shared a rare, mutual understanding. Naively, I thought, *"Since we understand each other so well, I don’t need to control my emotions anymore—I can simply share them with her."* In hindsight, this was incredibly irresponsible. I failed to realize the harm I was causing. For instance, I spent hours stuck in traffic, obsessing over how much time I was wasting. The more I thought, the more disappointed and unstable I became. Instead of managing this internally, I complained endlessly to her. This was just one example. When she eventually reached her limit, I wrongly blamed her for being "too weak." 

Recall my past life, the guilty to be too late to say sorry to her is the prize for me to grow up. I understand me much deeper now. It's meaningless to dive deeply on fleeting thoughts that only serve to distract me. I’ve come to understand how the world works, how to manage my expectations of others, and, most importantly, how to balance my expectations of myself, sometimes it's too low and sometimes it's too high. I am living in harmony with myself and well balanced. I can confidently say that, I have grown up.



After maybe one year, or even half a year, I will have more clear, deeper thoughts. I will build better strategy to understand everything around me. Recording is the best way to understand my past and future. Even this blog will show my negative aspects, it's still valuable part to describe my path, which is essential to be a human in society.
